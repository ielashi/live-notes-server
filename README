This is the server component of "Live Notes". The server is responsible for
managing and syncing between clients.

To run:
- Clone the repository.

- Open the directory of the repository.

- Create a folder called "lib" and include in it the following jars:
  - commons-codec-1.4.jar
  - google-gson-1.4
  - specs-1.6.2.1.jar
  - xSocket-2.8.9.jar

  These jars could easily be found and downloaded on the web.

- Run the following command to automatically download other dependencies:
  sbt update

- Run the following command to run the server:
  sbt "run <port-number>"

  where <port-number> is the port number you want the server to listen on.
  eg. sbt "run 8080" to run the server on port 8080
